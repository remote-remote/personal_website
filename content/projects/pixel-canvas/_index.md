Pixel Canvas is a real-time collaborative canvas that I've been working on as a learning experiment to better understand Elixir and the OTP platform.
Some of the project goals include:
- manual TCP/IP handling
- hand-rolled websocket implementation
- custom binary WS protocol
- targeting 1M messages per second
- custom telemetry infrastructure
