I've been interested in Elixir for quite some time now, and I've made a few different approaches toward understanding it. Like many, the first thing I did was install Phoenix and began building a simple web application. While this was an interesting shift for a dev coming from Node.js and SPA frameworks, I found that I wasn't gaining any intuition around the fundamentals of the BEAM, OTP and Elixir.

I decided to take a few steps back and try to truly build something from the ground up. I started on a LiveBook where I explored bare processes, messages and linking, then implementing my own version of Agents, Tasks and GenServers to understand the underlying concepts and patterns.

When these concepts started to click, I was searching for a real-world but simple use case for a collaborative platform.
