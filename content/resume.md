## Professional Experience

### Cleartrace

**Staff Software Engineer** *Sept 2024 – Present*

- Transform ambiguous product requirements into actionable technical roadmaps for enterprise renewable energy certificate (REC) management systems  
- Led API v2 redesign introducing modern OpenAPI standards and supplier asset management, establishing foundational architecture for enterprise-scale certificate tracking  
- Partner with product teams to identify and derisk technical implementation challenges early in feature planning cycle  
- Establish engineering standards and mentor team through code reviews, pair programming, and architectural guidance

**Senior Software Engineer** *Jan 2021 – Aug 2024*

- Architected real-time load matching engine processing energy market data across distributed Lambda functions, handling time-critical trading algorithms through iterative development and production hardening  
- Built comprehensive analytics platform (Dashboard v2) from ground up using TypeScript/Vue architecture, delivering customer-facing real-time energy data visualization  
- Led full application re-architecture, migrating from MongoDB to PostgreSQL/Rails stack, enabling enterprise multi-tenancy while reducing infrastructure complexity and improving query performance  
- Designed and executed data pipeline migration from distributed Lambda architecture to unified DBT/Snowflake system, consolidating time-series processing while maintaining zero downtime  
- Integrated enterprise SSO (Frontegg), replacing custom OAuth implementation to enable multi-tenant security compliance

**Software Engineer** *Sept 2018 – Jan 2021*

- Built fault-tolerant time-series ingestion API processing sub-minute readings from 500+ renewable energy assets, maintaining 99.9% uptime across 5+ years of continuous operation  
- Established core platform APIs for energy data processing, customer management, and real-time market integration  
- Designed distributed processing pipeline using AWS Lambda and SQS for time-critical energy market data across multiple ISO regions, handling data consistency and temporal aggregation challenges  
- Built resilient full-stack solutions across microservices architecture, adapting to dynamic requirements in real-time energy trading environments
